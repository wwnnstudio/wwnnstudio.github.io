For a couple of weeks all I could think of was how to make ceramic sardines. Friends were wanting an ashtray for their studio, and while any old tin can be an ashtray, I wanted to make a ceramic one. 

At the same time I saw a ceramic mosquito incense holder in the shape of a small barbecue. I forget what was on the grill but I thought fish might be cute and fun to make. This then morphed into the idea of making an ashtray in the shape of the dregs of a sardine tin. Something about the grossness of fish heads and bones in old tomato sauce to hold ashes appealed.

Version 1 had a fish head in the middle of the tin sticking up for smokers to knock ash off their cigs. I used a tail for one rest for a cig but struggled to think of other things to act as holders should people want to put their cigs down. I stuck on an oversized version of a pull tab but it was awkward and might not have been functional. 

In the end my fish head cracked because I had made it out of two slabs pressed together but the mitre was too deep and as it dried the edges pulled back apart. 

I remade it which I was actually excited about. I decided to use the fish heads as holders, pinching two heads with open mouths, the same tail and fish spine. I pinched a sardine just to see how relistic I could make it.

There will be more ceramic fish in future.
