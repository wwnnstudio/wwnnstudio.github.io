I had collected a bunch of ideas I wanted to throw, and had also been avoiding the new studio's red clay because it looked aggressively red. It indeed took me 30+ minutes to clean it all up after my throwing session. But the clay is nice -- gritty and soft at the same time. Softness is a credit to the studio's clay handling. 

Not having thrown for 2 months I was pretty happy with how I was able to shape the clay. It's true what they say -- clay feel is more important than just repetitive practice. Maybe especially when you're pretty new at it like I am. 

Trimming though. I don't think I am a paticularly cautious trimmer yet I feel like everytime it takes so incrediably long. 

And there's simply the fact that throwing and trimming takes a toll on my back.

And the resulting stuff is all just round. An aesthetic I'm not particularly interested in and therefore unsurprisingly not that good at.
