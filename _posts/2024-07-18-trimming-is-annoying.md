I had collected a bunch of ideas I wanted to throw, and had also been avoiding the new studio's red clay because it looked aggressively red. It indeed took me 30+ minutes to clean it all up after my throwing session. But the clay is nice -- gritty and soft at the same time. Softness is a credit to the studio's clay handling. 

Not having thrown for 2 months I was pretty happy with how I was able to shape the clay. It's true what they say -- clay feel is more important than just repetitive practice. Maybe especially when you're pretty new at it like I am. 

Trimming though. I don't think I am a paticularly cautious trimmer yet I feel like everytime it takes so incrediably long. 

And there's simply the fact that throwing and trimming takes a toll on my back.

I find my thrown forms lack a flamboyance, a sort of flair. I rarely feel the pull to throw lots of stuff. When I first started cermaics it was a desire to possess the skill. I feel like the augmentation of machinery should make my forms bigger, more dramatic, more flowy. But the reality is my skill isn't there and I don't feel the pull just now to do it until that emerges. And that's OK. 

### Recent pieces 
- Cat bowls.
  Thrown off the hump. Reasonably happy with these, they should function fine and they felt efficient to make.

- Mug.
  Wanted a tall footed mug to try drippy glazing. Foot not as tall as I wanted and nor is the mug. Made it an ergo handle will see if it ends up looking proportionate. Rim collasped a bit trying to trim just sticking down with water. Might stick to lugs in the future. 

- UFO.
  Fun challenge to throw it all in one. Did it successfully. Trimmed okay, bottom might still be a bit thick. Unsure of my "windows" as it now looks like a cat bell.

- Phone amplifiers.
  Tried two with 1kg clay each, they're just not big enough, don't look that great, and my lower walls still too thick. Prime example of my skill not there and the form is not inspiring me that much. **Scrapped**
