Since the official beginning of my "six months of ceramics making" is August, and I've hit a little lull in the things that I'm making, now seems to be a good time to list out the things I've been wanting to make and skills to develop. I've considered thinking of it as a a self-guided MFA, in so much that I make a syllabus for myself, and follow through on a few groups of works I will set myself to make. 

I've become comfortable with hand-sized objects. It is my primary way of experiencing and thinking of ceramic objects. Being able to think about how they would feel in the hand as finished objects, and to wrap my hands around the object while it is being made, makes it easier to conceive of a pleasing shape. Especially when pinching and hand building, it's instinctive to wrap my hands aound a form and feel whether or not I like it, and where it needs to be manipulated next.

I tried Paulus Berensohn's sketching exercise -- timed "sketches" with small handfuls of clay. I didn't do the eyes closed version as I was too self concious in a community studio, but I put my timer on and did 8 one-minute sketches. At first I was just making basic round pinch pots, and I wasn't sure the exercise was going to go anywhere. But in the end I felt a little looser and had a few interesting forms. These squished out cups I definitely find interesting.

### *The* syllabus

It's challenging to come up with categories, or a system. 

Do I go by skill type? throwing, pinching, slab building etc. But then thrown things can be altered and built upon, so can pinch pots. Slabs can be altered into curving shapes. I feel like the skill needs to follow the 
desired form. 

Thinking about things I've really enjoyed making so far. Realistic, kitschy things -- donuts, apples, sardines, lucky cats, soon to be more pumpkins. And then there are the more organic forms -- finned "radiator" cups, pinched trinket trays, experimenting with textures and runny glazes. Then, the smoother forms that might led themselves more to decoration, which I haven't done much of yet, -- bubble cups, just cups / mugs, and the squished cubes. 

I'll aim to make each of those a *series*, a group of objects with coherence in form, decoration and/ or concept. At least 12 small (sake cup) size objects, 8 medium (mug / bowl) size, more complex objects, and 1-2 large objects.
