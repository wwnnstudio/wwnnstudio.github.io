When I first started making ceramics I would be afriad I would make a thing and never be able to make it again. As a beginner, everyone is too precious about their pieces. It's one of the first lessons of ceramics, you can't be too precious about something until it's fully fired, given the unpredictable and long process. But it's also that being too afraid of a piece failing means you don't push the boundaries. Sure it's still can be annoying to remake things, but there is also satisfaction now in refining and making objects that are stronger, the process smoother. 

### Tale of two cats

I made the smaller cat cellar last year. Wanting a rounded cylindrical form for the body, I threw a cylinder with a thick bottom then trimmed it so that it had a rounded base. My throwing usually yields a form smaller than I envision -- a combination of the clay being wetter and therefore shrinking more, and my lack of skill. 

The tail sprang off the cat's back, the clay not having been smoothed enough after forming the curve of the tail. Materials have memory. When you make a curved piece of clay out of a coil, the outsider of the curve is stretched and the inside is squashed. You can actually see wrinkles on the inside and cracks may form on the outside. Smoothing with a sponge or finger will help the clay settle into its new shape. 

The second cat was made twice. The first time I formed the body out of a single slab made into a cylinder, then cut darts into the end to form the butt. The cylinder was too small to get my hand into to compress the butt so the in the end it cracked badly in the bisque firing. 

For the *second* second cat I made sure the cylinder was big enough to get my hand into. I formed the butt by moulding a round piece of slab around a tennis ball the studio had lying around, and then attached it to a cylinder. Attaching the feet now that it was the second time was also easier. I made little disc feet and then built up the legs. The first time I tried to make the legs and feet then attach but found the legs too weak to support the cylinder.

### It's hard to stay excited about decorating 

Having spent so long thinking of the form when making ceramics, I sometimes find it hard to think about and plan the decorating and glazing. The first cat was just striped according to how I think of a cartoon tabby. When it came time to decorate and glaze the second one, I looked up pictures of tabbies and tried to imitate how the stripes sometimes turn into spots and go from the back to the hind legs. 



Looking forward to when the desire strikes to make a third cat.
