When I first started making ceramics I would be afriad I would make a thing and never be able to make it again. As a beginner, everyone is too precious about their pieces. It's one of the first lessons of ceramics, you can't be too precious about something until it's fully fired, given the unpredictable and long process. But it's also that being too afraid of a piece failing means you don't push the boundaries. Sure it's still can be annoying to remake things, but there is also satisfaction now in refining and making objects that are stronger, the process smoother.
