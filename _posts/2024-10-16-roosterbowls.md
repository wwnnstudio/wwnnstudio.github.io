The word 'handmade' is powerful in our current age of ever-cheaper outsourced mass production. As consumers go in search of meaning and individuality, 'handmade' is a nice shortcut to something that *should* be unique. 

Funny anecdote ... during my first market, I noticed people's eyes sliding over my table, maybe looking a little confused. A few stopped to ask if I had made the ceramic items. I realized that these days it might be just as easy to assume that I had had these drop shipped from China. I added a sign prolcliaming "**HANDMADE CERAMICS**" and that seemd to help a little. 

What, though, does 'handmade' mean? Made by hand. Yes. Not mass produced, not really. 

The irony of my little anecdote is that even if they *had* been drop shipped from China, they would have been made by hand, just not by me. 

Clothing is the greatest example of the irony that presumes polar opposition between 'handmade' and 'mass produced'. Even the cheapest flimsy top from Shein will have been put through a sewing machine by human hands, as it is difficult for machines to manipulate fabric reliably because it is soft and flexible. Crochet items that have been cropping up more and more in fast fashion stores are 100% handmade -- to my knowledge there are currently no machines that crochet. 

The social media world of ceramics is full of of photos and videos of a young, good-looking person at a wheel in a sunny, clean studio, making mugs in small batches. Occasionally there are videos from Jingdezhen of uncles in their undershirts, chain smoking while turning the most beautiful and delicate porcelain tea cups. Then there are the masters in Korea and Japan, who showcase their particular sets of techniques for ceramics making in their traditions, often agaist a rustic backdrop of the courntryside or historical rural architecture.

> The rooster bowl was imported to Thailand from China. In the original artwork, the rooster symbolized hard work while the banana leaf and red peony represented dreams of good fortune.

> In 1957, entrepreneurs opened many rooster kitchenware factories in Thailand’s Lampang province. The region, teeming with clay minerals, was better suited for ceramic manufacturing.
> 
> As Lampang began mass producing tableware with rooster designs, the bowl became one of the region’s best-selling products—bringing financial stability and freedom to Lampang locals.
>
> Although Lampang continues to manufacture rooster bowls today, few factories can afford to design rooster bowls according to the traditional style and material, causing the original hand-painted rooster bowls to become a rare collector’s item.

So I decided to make myself a pair of rooster bowls in order to explore, in my own small way, the intircacies of dedicating my time to learning and practicing a craft. If I were being cliche a and a bit glib I would say it made me appreciate so much the skill that goes into making a painted bowl, but to me right now it just reflects the very different value we place on the status of the person handmaking the item.

This sort of shoots this post into the realm of "*what is art??*" so I'm going to leave it here.
