The puffer fish sketch had been living in my notebook for months, but had always felt too intimidating to start on - in terms of time commitment, and because it is a bigger thing to build. 

Making a sphere was the first challenge. I found a bowl plaster mould and padded the flat bottom with newspaper so it was closer to the shape I wanted. I built a sea urchin bowl as a warm-up. Trying out if and how the spikes would be able to support the form. I also wanted to see how heavy it might turn out. I could hollow out each spike if it came out hellishly heavy, but it seemed to be a lot of work for a little gain. 

The result was sturdier than expected and acceptable weight-wise, so I decided to keep it for, you know, stuff.

For the fish, I made two halves of the sphere and attached some of the spikes. Then left it to dry and firm up a little overnight, wrapped. Then came the fun part of joining! The mould was not quite a half sphere so to get there I added a strip of slab in between the two to get closer to roundness. I had made a chuck for the fish to sit on so its bottom spikes would not be crushed. Smoothed it as much as possible without denting the sphere too much. I'll cut a mouth later so there'll be a chance to get my hand in there and do more smoothing. The spikes provided some reference for fitting the two sides together but next time I should really use cardinal markings. 

Then the fun part of positioning eyes, fins, tail and the remaining spikes. And the all-important question: *do puffer fish have eyelids?*. According to google images they do, so I added some. 

The clay was just hard enough to cut the mouth. I used a cookie cutter to outline where it should be, then carefully took out a chunk of wall. I gave it some lips too, no google image reference check needed for that one. 

Then it was just time to smooth and compress everything, trying not to knock the tail off in the meantime. I love this part, feeling the clay get drier and stronger. This is where you can give your forms a *lift*. Usually they'll have settled and collasped a little from gravity during the building process. The fish had become more oval than round esp around the mouth where there was a piece of wall missing, and it was very satisfying to straighten the walls of its cheeks and feel the clay become able to hold the shape. 

With this all done, the slab I had rolled out to make the extra height in the sphere and its fins was actually in a perfect state so I had to use it to sketch out a little bonus toilet.
